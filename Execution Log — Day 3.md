Execution Log: AI Pillar - Day 3 (Jan 25, 2026)
Date: Sunday, January 25, 2026
Duration: 20 mins (concept stabilization)

Focus: AI as augmentation layer only—no tools, models, or Edge Impulse
Mentor Notes: Locked "AI justifies its existence" mindset. MVC = deploy + benchmark decision.

Task 1: AI Augmentation Principles
When should AI be used? Fuzzy pattern problems in dynamic environments (sensor anomalies, wear detection) where rules can't adapt.

When should deterministic logic win? Structured, predictable tasks needing precision/reliability (PID control, threshold checks).

Metrics justifying AI: Accuracy gain >20% without latency >50ms, power <2x baseline, or throughput loss.

Task 2: MVC Definition (Inference/Edge-Only)
MVC: Deploy pre-trained model → benchmark vs. logic baseline → decide "keep AI?" by metrics. Zero training.

AI Justified: Noisy data, pattern variability (vibration faults).
Logic Superior: Rule-based, repetitive ops (fixed thresholds).
